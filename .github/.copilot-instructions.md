# My Pattern for Create code (when i assign for implement or add or create Module)
- Separate code into two parts: View(UI) and Controller(Logic)
- Cls_ui.py  ( this is the View part ,create first ) main class name should be same as the file name
- Cls.py ( this is the Controller part ) main class name should be same as the file name too

# Ui Implementation Tasks
- Create file suffix: "_ui"
- don't implement __init__  in suffix "_ui" class

# Logic Implementation Tasks
- inherit from the class in suffix "_ui" file

# Importing Libraries or Modules
- import Libraries or system modules fist the import user-defined modules

# Testing
- Don't perform testing if i didn't ask for it

# chat history
- append chat history to history.md file
